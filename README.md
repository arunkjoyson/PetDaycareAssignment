Assignment #1: Getting organized.
Purpose:
In class, we talked about the importance of organization (Project Management) when it
comes to building high quality software.
We spoke about the ideal process of being able to have direct access to your clients;
however, this is often not the case. Your face time with clients can often be limited or can
easily get side tracked. So we want to enter the meeting prepared.
What this means is that you will need to do some preparation beforehand and make some
assumptions. The assumptions should be well laid out.
Be prepared with some questions that will help clarify the true intent of the customer.
In this assignment, you are being asked to demonstrate your ability to breakdown work.
Scenario:
Your client is a Pet Daycare. After interviews, you have arrived at the following:
• The owners are frustrated because onboarding new employees takes at least 3
months.
• The employees are frustrated because the process of onboarding a new client is
complicated. Each individual employee also has their own “flavour” when
processing the incoming client.
• The customers are frustrated because the onboarding flow is difficult to follow.
Outcome:
You are trying to prepare for your initial meeting with the client. What we are looking for is a
document of your preparations
Some must have topics:
• Broken down requirements
• Questions & what knowledge you are intending to expose.
• Possible follow up clarification questions that are generated from the information
you currently have.
• A set of preliminary tasks (name only) for fulfilling the requirements.
