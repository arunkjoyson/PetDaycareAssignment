Validation Approach:

•	Conduct stakeholder interviews (owners, employees, and customers) to confirm pain points.

•	Observe real onboarding sessions to identify issues.

•	Review existing documentation, tools, and workflows.

•	Collect data on current onboarding times and customer feedback.

•	Present initial findings to the client for confirmation before proceeding with solutions.
