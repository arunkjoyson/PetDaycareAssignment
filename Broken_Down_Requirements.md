Broken Down Requirements:

•	Employee Onboarding Standardization: The organization needs to 
create an organized onboarding system including specific training sections 
to shorten the existing 3-month education period.

•	Client Onboarding Improvement: Design a straightforward onboarding 
procedure which provides simple and identical steps that apply to the 
entire workforce.

•	Centralized Information Management: The organization should 
establish a digital system to safely store and retrieve both training 
materials and client information and onboarding checklists from a unified 
platform.

•	Process Automation: Introduce automation for repetitive onboarding 
tasks, such as digital forms, automated scheduling, and guided checklists.

•	Performance Metrics & Feedback Loop: Define measurable KPIs (e.g., 
onboarding time reduction, client satisfaction) and a mechanism to gather 
feedback for continuous improvement.

•	Integration with Existing Tools: If the daycare already uses any 
software (e.g., scheduling tools, customer management systems), ensure 
compatibility with new solutions.
