# Meeting Preparation Document: Pet Daycare Project

Purpose:

To prepare for an initial meeting with the Pet Daycare client by making assumptions, identifying key pain 
points, and formulating clarifying questions to ensure a structured approach to project management.
 
Broken Down Requirements:
•	Employee Onboarding Standardization: The organization needs to create an organized onboarding system 
including specific training sections to shorten the existing 3-month education period.
•	Client Onboarding Improvement: Design a straightforward onboarding procedure which provides simple and 
identical steps that apply to the entire workforce.
•	Centralized Information Management: The organization should establish a digital system to safely store 
and retrieve both training materials and client information and onboarding checklists from a unified platform.
•	Process Automation: Introduce automation for repetitive onboarding tasks, such as digital forms, 
automated scheduling, and guided checklists.
•	Performance Metrics & Feedback Loop: Define measurable KPIs (e.g., onboarding time reduction, client 
satisfaction) and a mechanism to gather feedback for continuous improvement.
•	Integration with Existing Tools: If the daycare already uses any software (e.g., scheduling tools, 
customer management systems), ensure compatibility with new solutions.
 
Assumptions & Validation:

Assumptions:

•	The current onboarding process is inconsistent, causing inefficiencies for employees and frustration for 
clients.
•	A centralized onboarding system does not currently exist.
•	Employees are not following a standardized procedure, leading to variations in client onboarding.
•	Customers face unclear steps when registering their pets, leading to delays.
•	The business is open to adopting a digital system for onboarding.
•	Training materials and resources may not be well-documented or accessible.
•	Reducing onboarding time will improve employee retention and customer satisfaction.
Validation Approach:
•	Conduct stakeholder interviews (owners, employees, and customers) to confirm pain points.
•	Observe real onboarding sessions to identify inconsistencies.
•	Review existing documentation, tools, and workflows.
•	Collect data on current onboarding times and customer feedback.
•	Present initial findings to the client for confirmation before proceeding with solutions.

Questions & Knowledge to Expose:

General Process Understanding:

      1.Can you walk us through the current employee onboarding process step by step?
      2.How do you currently train new employees, and what resources are provided?
      3.What are the most time-consuming aspects of training new hires?

      7. Are there any legal or compliance requirements for onboarding new pets?
      8. Do you currently use software for client intake and management?

Standardization and Process Improvement:

     9. Would a standardized checklist for employees improve consistency?
    10. How do employees currently handle customer queries during onboarding?
    11. Would a guided digital onboarding experience (e.g., an online portal) be beneficial?
    12. What has worked well in your onboarding process, and what needs improvement?

Business Goals and Expectations:

    13. What would an ideal onboarding experience look like for employees and clients?
    14. What timeline do you have for improving these processes?

•	Are there specific compliance requirements related to pet health and vaccinations?
•	How do you currently track employee progress during onboarding?
•	What are the biggest complaints from customers regarding onboarding?
•	Do employees receive ongoing training after the onboarding period?
•	Have you tried any previous process improvements? If so, what were the results?


Preliminary Tasks (Name & Deliverables):

•	Conduct stakeholder interviews – Gather insights from owners, employees, and customers.
•	Document current onboarding workflows – Map out the existing employee and client onboarding process.

process.
•	Define success metrics for onboarding improvements – The organization must establish performance 
indicators which include shorter onboarding duration and higher satisfaction levels from clients.
•	Present initial findings and recommendations – The research along with its findings and suggested 
solutions require summary presentation. 

Proposed Next Steps:
•	Conduct interviews and collect qualitative feedback.
•	Analyse data on current onboarding efficiency.
•	Identify potential software solutions and automation opportunities.
•	Develop a phased implementation roadmap.
•	Schedule follow-up meetings with the clients to refine and finalize recommendations.
